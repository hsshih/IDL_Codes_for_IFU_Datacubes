# IDL_Codes_for_IFU_Datacubes
Process and fit models to data cubes from Gemini GMOS and UH88 SNIFS
- Trims data cube
- Subtracts sky and continuum signal 
- Use hierarchical clustering to extract regions with sufficient signal-to-noise and bin data to achieve minimum signal-to-noise 
- Extracts spectra 
- Fit models to emission lines  
- Produce velocity maps
